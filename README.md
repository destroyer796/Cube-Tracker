# Cube-Tracker
This is a project made as a part of [Hermes]() by [Hack Club](). This is a custom pcb designed to track it's orientation and acceleration and use that to render a representation of it's orientation on a small OLED screen.

This pcb uses an ICM-42688-P accelerometer/gyroscope and a Seeed Studios Xiao RP2040 microprocessor. This sends a rendering over I2C of a box with the pcb's orientation.
